## Technologies

- [Astro + Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build)
  - [Starlight’s docs](https://starlight.astro.build/)
  - [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build)

## 🚀 Project Structure

Like any Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```bash
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

- starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory.
- each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.
- images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.
- static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
