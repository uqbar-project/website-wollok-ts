## Highlighter

One of the first things the editor offers us is **syntax highlighting**.

## Autocomplete

The editor also comes with **autocompletion** capabilities.

<video controls="" autoplay="" transition:persist>
  <source src="/assets/tour/editor/autocomplete1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

For example, we can create pepita, a bird that has energy and knows how to fly. We activate the autocompletion of Wollok's syntactic elements using the keys `Ctrl + Space`.
Once autocompletion is selected, you can use the `Tab` key to move between the offered _placeholders_.


Here we use more specific content assistants to, for example, know what messages to send to an object, which is activated with the `.` character

<video controls="" autoplay="" transition:persist>
  <source src="/assets/tour/editor/autocomplete2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

This tool works for `describe`, `tests`, `object`, `classes`, `imports`, `class`, `initializers` and more...
**We recommend using it!**


## Navigation

Don't get lost among your files!
We have several tools so you can navigate the code without problems.

  <source src="/assets/tour/editor/navigation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

### Quick Search Tools

- `Ctrl + P`: To search for a file
- `Ctrl + Shift + O`: To search for elements within a file
- `Ctrl + T`: To search for elements within the entire project

You can also use the elements tree

### Usage - Definition Navigation

By using `Ctrl + Click` with the mouse, you can navigate between the definition and uses of a variable.
It's also useful for navigating between message sends and methods!

### Outline

Use the _shortcut_ `Ctrl + Shift + P` + search for `Focus on Outline view` to open the _Outline_.

## Shortcuts

Familiarizing yourself with the editor is fundamental to feeling comfortable in the work environment.
That's why we advise you to check out [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_default-keyboard-shortcuts) where they tell you about the most useful VSCode _shortcuts_ (and even how to extend them if you want).
