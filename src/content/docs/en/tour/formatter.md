title: Formatter
description: Wollok Formatter in VSCode.
---

Wollok has a syntax-based formatter that styles code and gives it a homogeneous format, something necessary in an educational language that proposes projects where a working group is formed.

To activate it, while on a file, it's commonly `Ctrl + Shift + F`, otherwise you can check [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_rich-languages-editing).


<video controls="" autoplay="" transition:persist>
  <source src="/assets/tour/formatter/formatter.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>

An alternative to this is to enable the option to automatically format the file on save.
To do this, go to the IDE settings (`Ctrl + ,`) + check the `format on save` option.


### Configuration


From the IDE settings (`Ctrl + ,`) + search for `Wollok formatter`, you'll find the available configurations for the Wollok _formatter_.
